Chiron GoRound TC Webfont (TrueType)
================================

## About

This npm package provides a variation of
the [Chiron GoRound TC (昭源環方) webfont](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chiron-go-round-tc-webfont) webfont. The key
distinction lies in the font’s outline format, which is offered in TrueType outlines. In specific cases, using the
TrueType flavor may result in improved display quality on platforms like Windows. However, note that the TrueType
font files are larger compared to their OpenType counterparts.

[Chiron GoRound TC (昭源環方)](https://github.com/chiron-fonts/chiron-hei-hk) is a CJK typeface derived from the Source Han
Sans / Noto Sans CJK font family. It aims to provide a
modern, region-agnostic glyph set adopting the “written” style that is similar to the prevailing, usually commercial,
typefaces. This makes it suitable for use in a Traditional Chinese environment.

Chiron GoRound TC is available in several configurations: OpenType/CFF (OTF), TrueType (TTF), OpenType/CFF2 (OTF) variable
font, TrueType variable font, and the webfont version in WOFF File Format 2.0 (WOFF2) variable font format.

This package provides the webfont (WOFF2/TTF) build of the font. It utilizes Unicode-range subsetting technology to
reduce
download size and improve loading performance. Check out the
project's [Github repository](https://github.com/chiron-fonts/chiron-go-round-tc) for a complete README, and the font
family's [website](https://chiron-fonts.github.io) for usage examples (both in Chinese only).
