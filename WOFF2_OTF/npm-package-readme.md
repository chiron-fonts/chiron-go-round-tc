Chiron GoRound TC Webfont
======================

## About

This package contains the webfont version of [Chiron GoRound TC (昭源環方)](https://github.com/chiron-fonts/chiron-go-round-tc).

Chiron GoRound TC is a CJK typeface derived from the Source Han Sans / Noto Sans CJK font family. It aims to provide a
modern, region-agnostic glyph set adopting the “written” style that is similar to the prevailing, usually commercial,
typefaces such that it is suitable for use in a Traditional Chinese environment.

Chiron GoRound TC is available in several configurations: OpenType/CFF (OTF), TrueType (TTF), OpenType/CFF2 (OTF) variable
font, TrueType variable font, and the webfont version in WOFF File Format 2.0 (WOFF2) variable font format.

This package provides the webfont (WOFF2) build of the font. It utilizes Unicode-range subsetting technology to reduce
download size and improve loading performance. Check out the
project's [Github repository](https://github.com/chiron-fonts/chiron-go-round-tc) for a complete README, and the font
family's [website](https://chiron-fonts.github.io) for usage example (both in Chinese only).
